# 🌄 Real-Time 3D Procedural Terrain in Python

This project renders a real-time **procedural 3D terrain** using **Perlin noise** and displays it in a **wireframe mode** with `PyOpenGL` and `pygame`. The scene simulates a smooth "flyover" effect through dynamically generated terrain.

---

## 🎯 Features

- 🌀 Real-time animated terrain with Perlin noise
- 🔷 Clean wireframe rendering using OpenGL
- 🚀 Flyover animation driven by vertical noise offset
- 🎮 Interactive window with `pygame`
- ⚙️ Easily adjustable grid resolution and noise parameters

---

## 📦 Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- OpenGL-compatible GPU

---


### 📥 Install Dependencies

Install required packages with:

```bash
pip install pygame PyOpenGL noise numpy

---

#### 🙏 Acknowledgements
This project was inspired by open tools and learning resources:
PyOpenGL – Python bindings for OpenGL
pygame – For window management and event loop
Perlin Noise Python package by Casey Duncan – Used to generate smooth terrain heights
Daniel Shiffman / The Coding Train – Inspiration for procedural terrain generation
Thanks to the open-source community and educators!
